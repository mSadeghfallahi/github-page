## About This Project

I built this portfolio to serve as a central hub for my work, research, and professional journey. As a medical student with strong interests in AI, computational neuroscience, and interdisciplinary research, this site is meant to present a coherent narrative of how those domains intertwine in my projects and publications.

The portfolio captures:

* Who I am (background, education, research interests)
* My professional and research experiences
* Selected projects (with links to GitHub)
* Publications & academic presence
* Contact / social links

It’s designed to be clean, responsive, and lightweight — a straightforward showcase without unnecessary bloat.
